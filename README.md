Thank you Dayuan Jiang for making this!

Original README:

# TechRSS

AI-curated daily tech digest from 94 independent blogs, scored and summarized in Chinese.

**Live site**: https://dayuanjiang.github.io/TechRSS/

## How it works

1. **Fetch** - Pulls RSS feeds from 94 independent tech blogs (Simon Willison, Paul Graham, Troy Hunt, Krebs on Security, etc.)
2. **Score** - Each article is scored by AI (GLM-4.7 via Amazon Bedrock) on three dimensions: depth, novelty, and breadth (1-10)
3. **Summarize** - Top articles get a Chinese title and 3-5 sentence Chinese summary
4. **Publish** - Static site rebuilt and deployed to GitHub Pages

Runs incrementally every 30 minutes via GitHub Actions. Only new articles trigger AI calls.
